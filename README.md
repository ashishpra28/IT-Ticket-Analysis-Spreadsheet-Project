# 📊 IT Ticket Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing IT support ticket data to evaluate operational performance, identify inefficiencies, and recommend data-driven improvements. Using Google Sheets, I transformed raw IT ticket records into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards and analytical reporting.

The analysis helps understand ticket trends, agent performance, resolution efficiency, and customer satisfaction to support better decision-making in IT support operations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze IT ticket volumes and trends over time  
- Evaluate agent performance using resolution time and satisfaction metrics  
- Identify peak and stable periods in ticket handling  
- Detect bottlenecks based on request categories, severity, and priority  
- Provide actionable recommendations for process improvement  

## 📂 Dataset
- IT ticket records containing ticket IDs, dates, categories, priorities, severity levels, resolution time, satisfaction ratings, and agent details  
- Time period covered: **2016–2020**  
- Total records analyzed: **97,000+ tickets**

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **Google Sheets**
  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
  - Slicers & Filters
  - Dynamic Dashboards
  - Advanced formulas for data transformation
- **Data Analysis**
  - Trend analysis
  - Performance evaluation
  - Correlation analysis
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling**

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Monthly and yearly ticket volume trends  
- Average resolution time and satisfaction analysis  
- Ticket distribution by category, priority, and severity  
- Agent performance comparison (Top & Bottom performers)  
- Severity vs resolution time correlation  
- Peak vs off-peak ticket handling periods  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Ticket volumes increased consistently year-over-year, with clear peak periods during certain months  
- Satisfaction levels remained stable overall, with minor dips during high-volume periods  
- Certain request categories and severity levels required longer resolution times  
- A small group of agents showed higher resolution times and lower satisfaction, indicating training needs  
- Experienced agents demonstrated better customer satisfaction outcomes  

## ✅ Recommendations
- Improve workload balancing during peak periods  
- Provide targeted training for low-performing agents  
- Optimize processes for high-resolution-time categories  
- Invest in better ticket management tools and automation to reduce resolution time  

## 📈 Dashboard Preview
The interactive dashboard visualizes:
- Ticket volume trends  
- Agent performance metrics  
- Category and severity breakdowns  
- Resolution and satisfaction trends
